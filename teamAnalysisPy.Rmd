*And she's got brains enough for two, which is the exact quantity the girl who marries you will need.*

*"I'm not absolutely certain of the facts, but I rather fancy it's Shakespeare who says that it's always just when a fellow is feeling particularly braced with things in general that Fate sneaks up behind him with the bit of lead piping."*

*"A melancholy-looking man, he had the appearance of one who has searched for the leak in life's gas-pipe with a lighted candle."*

*"It isn't often that Aunt Dahlia lets her angry passions rise, but when she does, strong men climb trees and pull them up after them."*

*"Some minds are like soup in a poor restaurant - better left unstirred."*

The functions below perform analysis of Test teams

##2a. Wins vs Loss against opposition
This function performs analysis of Test teams against other teams at home/away or neutral venue.
**Note**:- The opposition can be a vector of opposition teams. Similarly homeOrAway can also be a vector of
home/away/neutral venues.



```{python opposition1,cache=TRUE,fig.width=10}
import cricpy.analytics as ca
# Get the performance of Indian test team against all teams at all venues as a dataframe
df =ca.teamWinLossStatusVsOpposition("indiaTest.csv",teamName="India",opposition=["all"], homeOrAway=["all"], matchType="Test", plot=False)
print(df)

# Plot the performance of Indian Test team  against all teams at all venues
ca.teamWinLossStatusVsOpposition("indiaTest.csv",teamName="India",opposition=["all"],homeOrAway=["all"],matchType="Test",plot=True)

# Get the performance of Australia against India, England and New Zealand at all venues in Tests
df =ca.teamWinLossStatusVsOpposition("southafricaTest.csv",teamName="South Africa",opposition=["India","England","New Zealand"],homeOrAway=["all"],matchType="Test",plot=False)
